# How to contribute
We ❤️ pull requests. If you'd like to fix a bug, contribute a feature or
just correct a typo, please feel free to do so, as long as you follow
our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Shopify/slate-cli/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If you're thinking of adding a big new feature, consider opening an
issue first to discuss it to ensure it aligns to the direction of the
project (and potentially save yourself some time!).

## Getting Started
To start working on the codebase, first fork the repo, then clone it:
```
git clone git@github.com:your-username/slate-cli.git
```
*Note: replace "your-username" with your Github handle*

Install the project's dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Symlink `slate` to your globals
```
npm link
```

Write some features.

Add some tests and make your change. Re-run the tests with:
```
npm run test
```

## Documentation
If your change affects how people use the project (i.e. adding or
changing arguments to a function, adding a new function, changing the
return value, etc), please ensure the documentation is also updated to
reflect this. Documentation is in the `README.md`.

If further documentation is needed, please communicate via Github Issues.

## Changelog

The [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Shopify/slate-cli/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file is generated by the gem [github_changelog_generator](https://github.com/skywinder/github-changelog-generator).  Changelog will itemize changes between tags on GitHub.

The changelog is updated by the repo's maintainers since a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with repository access is needed to handle GitHub's API call limits.  

Note to maintainers: To update the changelog, install the gem and run `github_changelog_generator` in the root directory.  Paste updates to the changelog in the tag notes, see example: [v0.10.0 tag notes](https://github.com/Shopify/slate-cli/releases/tag/v0.10.0).
