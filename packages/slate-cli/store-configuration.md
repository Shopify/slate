# Store / Environment Configuration Tips

Knowing what to put in your `config.yml` isn't always straightforward.  This guide aims to clarify what data is needed, and where to get it.

_Note: [ThemeKit](http://shopify.github.io/themekit/) is the tool that powers Slate deploys.  See it's
[configuration variables documentation](http://shopify.github.io/themekit/configuration/) for more details._

#### `config.yml` environment properties

- **store:** the shopify-specifc URL for this store/ environment (ie. [my-store.myshopify.com](https://my-store.myshopify.com)).
- **theme_id:** the unique id for the theme you want to write to when deploying to this store / environment
- **password:** the password generated via a private app on this store / environment (necessary for API access)

### Finding your theme_id

_**warning:** some commands ([`start`](https://github.com/Shopify/slate/blob/master/packages/slate-cli#start), [`deploy`](https://github.com/Shopify/slate/blob/master/packages/slate-cli#deploy)) will overwrite the existing code on this `theme_id` with empty boilerplate.
To avoid losing work, we suggest you go to [/admin/themes](https://my-store.myshopify.com/admin/themes) and duplicate
an existing theme to work from._

Go to your store's [/admin/themes.xml](https://my-store.myshopify.com/admin/themes.xml),
and copy the `id` for the theme you would like to update:

  _alternatively, you can set the `theme_id` to **"live"** to update the published theme_

### Generating your password

  Navigate to your store's private apps page ([/admin/apps/private](https://my-store.myshopify.com/admin/apps/private)).

  Create a new private app and copy the password:

  Assign the private app permissions to "Read and Write" for theme templates and theme assets:
