# Commands

## Global commands

| Command | Usage |
| :------ | :---- |
| [theme](#theme) | `slate theme [name] [--options]` |
| [migrate](#migrate) | `slate migrate [--options]` |
| [help](#help) | `slate -h` |
| [version](#version) | `slate -v` |

### theme

```
slate theme [name]
```

Generate a new blank theme. The `name` argument is required for the new theme directory.

##### Options
```
--yarn  install theme dependencies with yarn instead of npm
```

> **Note about Yarn:** While Yarn is not the default installer for dependencies, it is worth noting that Yarn has significant performance improvements and we do recommend installing dependencies via `--yarn`. [Read more about installing Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

### migrate
```
slate migrate
```

Converts an existing theme to work with Slate. Run this command from your project root to install dependencies and restructure your theme files into a `src/` directory. Empty `icons/`, `styles/`, and `scripts/` folders will also be created.  

A `config.yml` will also be created in your root directory which is required for [build commands](#build-commands) and [sync commands](#sync-commands).

##### Options
```
--yarn  install theme dependencies with yarn instead of npm
```

### help

```
slate [command] -h, slate [command] --help
```

Outputs help information for Slate (`slate --help`) or a specific command (`slate deploy --help`).

### version

```
slate -v, slate --version
```

Outputs the current version of Slate and its dependencies installed on your system.

## Build commands

Slate's source theme files are in the root `src` folder. These are the files you edit and will be compiled to a Shopify-compatible theme in the `dist` folder. You can do this a few different ways.

| Command | Usage |
| :------ | :---- |
| [build](#build) | `slate build` |
| [test](#test) | `slate test` |
| [zip](#zip) | `slate zip` |

### build

```
slate build
```

Compile theme files and assets into a Shopify theme, found in the `dist` folder. No files will be uploaded to your shop.

### test

```
slate test
```

Uses the [@shopify/theme-lint](https://github.com/Shopify/theme-lint) package to run translation tests on your locales found in the `/src/locales` folder. The package checks for untranslated keys inside of your Liquid templates, missing translation keys in specific locale files, and translation key HTML validity.

### zip

```
slate zip
```

Performs a fresh build of your theme and zips it into a file that's compatible with Shopify. The zip file can be found within an `upload` folder that is generated within your theme project root folder. The zip is overwritten each time you use this command and is not meant to be used for versioning.

## Sync commands

| Command | Usage |
| :------ | :---- |
| [deploy](#deploy) | `slate deploy [--options]` |
| [watch](#watch) | `slate watch [--options]` |
| [start](#start) | `slate start [--options]` |

### deploy

```
slate deploy [--options]
```

Performs a fresh build followed by a full deploy; replacing existing files on the remote server and replacing them with the full set of build files, and removing remote files that are no longer in use.

##### Options

```
-e, --env  deploy to a comma-separated list of environments
-m, --manual  disable auto-deployment of the theme files
```

Deploy to a specific environment with the `-e` flag (short for `--env`) plus the environment name: `slate deploy -e staging`.  You can deploy to multiple environments at once with comma-separated values: `slate deploy -e development,staging,production`.

Running `slate deploy --manual` will instead create a new zip file of your theme (see [slate zip](#zip)) and open the admin themes page as defined by your environment where you can then manually install your theme from the zip file.

### watch

```
slate watch [--options]
```

Sets up the watchers for all theme assets and deploys the compiled versions to your specified environment (default is `development`). Also opens a [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/) window with live reloading after changing and saving a file.

##### Options
```
-e, --env  deploy to a specific environment
-n, --nosync  disable Browsersync
```

> **Note about Browsersync on HTTPS:** The first time you run `slate watch` or `start` you will get an unsafe connection browser notice. This is expected because all Shopify stores run on HTTPS but no certificate exists for your localhost. Proceed through this warning to view your store.

### start

```
slate start [--options]
```

Performs a full deploy of your theme (see [slate deploy](#deploy)) and starts the watchers (see [slate watch](#watch)).

##### Options
```
-e, --env  deploy to a comma-separated list of environments
-n, --nosync  disable Browsersync
```
