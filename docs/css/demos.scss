  GitHub pages does not allow you to import scss files outside of the `docs/`
  folder (even though it works locally). This means we can't reference Slate's src/ folder with:
    "../../src/styles/tools/mixins.scss".

  Instead, we can use the live URL.
  Since the repo is currently private this won't work either (yet).
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shopify/slate/master/src/styles/tools/mixins.scss"

  Until that repo is made public, I've added the contents of `/src/styles/`
  to `/docs/_sass` in the `slate/` folder. We can switch to live URLs after that.
