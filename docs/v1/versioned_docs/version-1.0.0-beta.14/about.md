title: Slate - End of Support (January 2020)
original_id: about
---

After re-evaluating Slate and its current state, Shopify has decided to officially end support for Slate.

### Why?

With the launch of our new [section theme architecture](https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/development/sections-architecture) we're taking a step back to examine our current tooling and how we can deliver the best theming experience to our theme developers. 

Slate is not in line with our vision for themes moving forward and it does not solve two of the larger asks our theme developers have made:

* Local development of a Shopify theme
* Support for code versioning within themes

### Iâ€™m a theme developer that is using Slate. What should I do now?

Slate was built upon [Theme Kit](https://github.com/Shopify/themekit) as an opinionated way to setup up a Shopify theme build. Shopify will continue to actively maintain and support the growth of Theme Kit through the open-source community.

You can continue using Slate the way you have been. While we will not be maintaining it any longer, you can still fork the repo to suit your own needs.
