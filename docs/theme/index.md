# What's included

Slate is made up of two parts. The first part is a theme scaffold consisting of templates, sections, starter styles, and helper scripts to develop your theme on. The second part is a toolkit of useful commands to sync your local files to your live store.

Learn more about the [theme scaffold](/slate/theme-scaffold) and [commands](/slate/commands).

## Intentionally blank

Standard liquid tags and logic likely to be used on each template have been included with little to no markup, classes, or other code that you will need to strip out. Below is an image of what Slate looks like out of the box.
