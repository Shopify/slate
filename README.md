## ⚠ Slate on Low Maintenance
Due to project priority and resource constraints, this project is currently on low maintenance. We recognize that there are a lot of activities around this package. However, we are unable to accommodate the maintenance this project requires.

### What does this mean?
Slate will not have new features or bug fixes during this period.

As a Shopify repository maintainer, there will be no activities around:

- New feature implementation
- Existing feature changes
- Major bugs due to any tools version changes
- Major bugs due to Shopify internal changes
- Minor bugs
- Will not evaluate and merge any community created PRs
- Will not address any community reported issues except ones that implicate Shopify security

### Should I continue using Slate?
You may. As it is, Slate is still useful for Shopify themes development.

### What happened? Why are you stopping? Will Shopify work on Slate in the future?
Due to Shopify priorities and resource constraints, we have decided to put more emphasis on other projects. We have plans to return to Slate once our priorities change. While evaluating the current state of Slate, there are two key developer workflows that we are not satisfied with:

- **Local development** - Slate is not a true local development environment
- **File integrity (GitFlow and code version control)** - Slate does not offer the ability to be the source of truth for theme files

We would like to address these two points above when we have our focus back on Slate.

**This low maintenance period is time-boxed to 6 months from March 2019. We will re-visit and re-evaluate the project priority and plans for next steps.**
